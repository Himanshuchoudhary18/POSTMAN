# POSTMAN
This is POSTMAN CLONE project

#STEPS
1) This project is made by using JS & Bootstrap
2) Here, using bootstraps i gave it a simple UI where there are 3 buttons one for GET, second for POST request and third is for submit button "whatever request is finalize will get submit and then "the response will be fetched and shown in the response box"
3) Here, user can have there custom paremeters also they can ssimply add more parameters by clicking on "+" and can remove parameters by clicking on "-" button
4) It is not made very attractive but it basically solves the purpose of POSTMAN
